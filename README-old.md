# Deep  Transfer  Learning  for  Crop  Yield  Prediction  with  Remote Sensing  Data

This project implements the deep learning architectures from [You et al. 2017](http://sustain.stanford.edu/crop-yield-analysis/) and applies them to developing countries with significant agricultural productivity (Argentina, Brazil, India).

We also examine the efficacy of transfer learning of yield forecasting insights between adjoining countries; some results were published in the proceedings of [COMPASS 2018](https://acmcompass.org/program/). Our paper can be viewed [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ei49eck573yxi6f/deep-transfer-learning.pdf?dl=0).
